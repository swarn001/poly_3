# zkSNARK Circuit and Proof

## Overview üîç

This repository provides a demonstration of zkSNARK circuit and proof generation using the Hardhat and Ethers libraries. The project showcases the following steps:

- Writing a correct `circuit.circom` implementation
- Compiling the circuit to generate circuit intermediaries
- Generating a proof using specific inputs (A=0 and B=1)
- Deploying a Solidity verifier contract on the Mumbai Testnet
- Calling the `verifyProof()` method on the verifier contract and asserting the output is true.

## Installation üñ•Ô∏è

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Install the project dependencies using npm:
4. Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory and set your private key that has test MATIC tokens in it:

PRIVATE_KEY='YOUR_SECRET_KEY'

## Contract Deployment and Circuit Compilation ‚ö°

To compile the circuit and deploy the verifier contract on the Mumbai Testnet, execute the following steps:

1. Compile the circuit and generate the `CustomCircuitVerifier.sol` contract:
npx hardhat circom


2. Deploy the contract to the Mumbai Testnet and perform the proof verification:
npx hardhat run --network mumbai scripts/deploy.ts


This script will deploy the `CustomCircuitVerifier.sol` contract on the Mumbai network, generate a proof from the circuit intermediaries using `generateProof()`, generate calldata with `generateCallData()`, and finally, call `verifyProof()` on the verifier contract with the calldata deployed to Mumbai.
